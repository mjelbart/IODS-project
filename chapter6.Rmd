# Chapter 6: Analysis of longitudinal data

Note: As you read the data sets in your chapter6.Rmd you may have to factor the categorical variables again, as R may not recognise them automatically as factors.

Note that you must SWAP the data sets! :) It is NOT a simple copy & paste of my book!

## 1. Analyses of Chapter 8 of MABS using the RATS data
### Graphs or analysis results 
### Interpretations

```{r}
rats <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/rats.txt", sep = " ")

names(rats)

# Look at the structure of rats
str(rats)

# Print out summaries of the variables
summary(rats)
```


## 2. Analyses of Chapter 9 of MABS using the BPRS data. 
### Graphs or analysis results
### Interpretations

```{r}
bprs <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/BPRS.txt", sep = " ")

names(bprs)
```


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, warning=FALSE}
```
